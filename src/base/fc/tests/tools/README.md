# FC Manual Testing Tools

This directory contains manual testing and development tools for the FC library.
All tools use the `*_test_tool` naming convention to distinguish them from automated unit tests.

## Build

These tools are built separately from the automated test suite (`fc_tests`):

```bash
cd build
make <tool_name>
```

## Available Tools

Source files use the `*_test_tool.cpp` suffix, but executables are built with `*_test` names:

- **ecc_interop_test** - ECC implementation interoperability testing
  - Tests compatibility between OpenSSL, secp256k1, and mixed implementations
  - Usage: `./ecc_interop_test <password> [interop_file]`
  - See also: `ecc_interop_test.sh` for automated testing across implementations

- **log_test** - SHA256 logarithm approximation verification
  - Validates `approx_log_32()` implementation against reference data
  - Requires: `log_test.txt` (generated by `log_test.py`)
  - Usage: `./log_test`

- **saturation_exhaustive_test** - Exhaustive saturation arithmetic testing
  - Tests all possible int8_t and int16_t value combinations
  - Long running - use for thorough validation
  - Usage: `./saturation_exhaustive_test`

- **sha_test** - Manual SHA256 hash output verification
  - Outputs SHA256 hashes for visual inspection
  - Usage: `./sha_test`

- **websocket_api_test** - WebSocket API server/client demonstration
  - Example of using FC's WebSocket and RPC facilities
  - Usage: `./websocket_api_test`

- **file_mutex_test** - Interactive file mutex testing
  - Manual testing of file-based mutex operations
  - Usage: `./file_mutex_test <lock_file_path>`
  - Commands: L (lock), l (lock_shared), U (unlock), u (unlock_shared), q (quit)

- **thread_sleep_test** - Thread sleep behavior demonstration
  - Usage: `./thread_sleep_test`

- **rate_limiting_test** - Network rate limiting demonstration
  - Downloads files while demonstrating rate limiting
  - Usage: `./rate_limiting_test`

## Scripts

- **log_test.py** - Generates test data for log_test
  - Usage: `./log_test.py > log_test.txt`

- **ecc_interop_test.sh** - Automated ECC interoperability test suite
  - Builds ecc_interop_test with different implementations and tests compatibility
  - Usage: `./ecc_interop_test.sh`

## Note

These tools are intended for development and manual verification purposes.
They are not part of the automated test suite (`fc_tests`).
